=head1 NAME

rhostck - tell rblsmtpd to block mails from hosts with suspicious names

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rhostck rblsmtpd> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<rhostck> is supposed to run under B<tcpserver(1)> and to execute
B<rblsmtpd(1)>.

B<rhostck> checks the C<$TCPREMOTEHOST> environment variable. It may
decide to set the C<$RBLSMTPD> environment variable in order to tell
B<rblsmtpd> to reject the incoming SMTP delivery request.

By default B<rhostck> instructs B<rblsmtpd> to reject only remote hosts
without a hostname. With the environment variable C<$RHOSTCK_DENYPARTS>
a space separated list of name parts of a hostname can be defined, that
typically occur in hostnames of dynamic lines. B<rhostck> splits the
remote hostname at the dots and looks at each part in front of the 2nd
last dot. C<$RBLSMTPD> will be set, if at least one such part exists and
starts with one of the parts given in C<$RHOSTCK_DENYPARTS>.

The error message for B<rblsmtpd> is taken from the content of
C<$RHOSTCK_DENYMSG>. If this is not set or emtpy the default text is
C<"-Suspicious hostname - I don't accept mails from hosts on dynamic IP addresses.">;
it starts with a hyphen to instruct B<rblsmtpd> to terminate the
connection with a 553 permanent error.
Eventually B<rhostck> executes the command given as its first argument,
which is B<rblsmtpd> normally.
